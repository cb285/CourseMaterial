Memory Managment

(This file best viewed using a fixed-width font.)

The files in this directory represent page reference strings.  Each
file contains 10000 references of the form <pid, page#> where pid is a
process id and page# is the VM page being referenced by process pid.

The files were created using the following algorithm.  

  1. Initially, randomly choose a page # to start.  Push this page # onto
     a stack.
  2. For subsequent page references, with some (high) probability s, the
     next page reference will be the same page #.
  3. If the next page reference is not the same page, then with some
     other (high) probability o, it will be either the page # before or the
     page after # (choose equally between the two).
  4. Otherwise, the next page reference is with 75% probability the
     page # on the top of the stack (modeling a function return) and
     the stack is popped or with 25% probability a randomly picked
     page # (modeling a function call) and this new page # is pushed
     onto the stack.

Setting different values of s and o affect the locality of the program
that is being simulated.  Higher probabilities should create reference
strings where more locality is exhibited.  The probabilities of 98%
and 95% were used for s and o in all 4 combinations for each process.

Files of references for 10, 50, and 100 processes were created by
randomly choosing a file for an individual process and reading out 100
references to a new file.  This was repeated until 10000 references
were put into the new file.  (Due to the random nature of picking a
process to "run", it is entirely possible that the files do not
contain references for exactly 10, 50, and 100 processes,
respectively, but that will be the bounds on the maximum number in
each file.)  This was done for each of the combinations of
probabilities.

There are 16 data files (4 probability combinations for 1, 10, 50, and
100 processes).  They are named in the following format:
<#proc>p<s><o>.dat, where #proc is the number of processes represented
in the file, and s and o are the probabilities explained above.  For
example, 50p9895.dat is a file with references for 50 processes using
s=98 and o=95.

As noted in the assignment, each one of these files should be run
through your simulator for frame sizes of 10, 50 and 100.  Each run
should generate 3 values, the number of page faults for the FIFO, LRU,
and OPT replacement algorithms.  The summary tables should look
something like the following.  One block is filled in with the results
from the instructor's sample implementation to give you a reference.
